                <h2>MONDAY</h2>
                <p>
                   On Monday, I only have the WEBDESIGN class.<br>But at night is when it gets busy.<br>
                   Since I have both ROCOCO class and WEBDESIGN class the next day, <br> 
                   the amount of home work is unmatched.<br>
                   When I get back from class at 6:00, I start with my ROCOCO homework. <br>
                   By the time pages and pages of fancy french words start to give me a headache, I get something to eat, and take a short break. <br>
                   When that's done (sorta) I move onto the WEBDESIGN homework. <br>
                   Let's just pray that I can wake up on time the tomorrow.

                <p>
                    The day has come.<br>
                    Tuesday is the busiest day for me. My schedule is packed from 9 to 6.<br> 
                    I'm still tired from all the homework last night.<br>
                    Listening to my professor talk, I can feel my eye lids getting heavier. <br>
                    But after I've made through the long 3 hours, I get fuelled up and alive again. <br>
                    After lunch is WEBDESIGN time! <br>
                    I wonder which class is for tomorrow.

                <h2>WEDSDAY</h2>
                <p>
                    Wednesdays are kind of weird.<br>
                    I have either ROCOCO or WEBDESIGN depending on the week.<br> 
                    It's still confusing after 3 weeks, so I have to check the schedule again.<br>
                    On days I have WEBDESIGN, I get to sleep in so that's great. <br>
                    There's no class tomorrow, so after class is free!

                <h2>FRIDAY</h2>
                <p>
                    Friday is a short day. I just have ROCOCO. <br>
                    At first I thought it would be impossible to take 2 courses, <br>
                    but I guess it wasn't too bad. <br>
                    In class, we study the arts and history of 18th century France, <br>
                    As well as pay visits to the museum to study the artworks of the era. <br>
                    I'm making something special for the final project. <br>
                    After class is sweet, sweet weekend.

                    It's still saturday, but I have to start doing ROCOCO homework <br>
                    Unless I want to work my butt off on sunday. <br>
                    But I could get up anytime I want so that's a luxury. <br>
                    Afterwards, I do some chores in the house, catch up on shows, <br>
                    getting some me time.

                   Getting ready for next week on Sunday. <br>
                   I finish up on the leftover homework and prepare for class. <br>
                   Get some sleep, here comes another day!
